# Sensor-Project
Description:

Developed an Arduino code for an ESP32 device that integrates sensors and Bluetooth technology to provide real-time data monitoring and visualization. The device collects information from various sensors and wirelessly transmits it to a companion mobile app via Bluetooth. This enables users to conveniently access and analyze the data on their smartphones.
The companion app offers multiple data retrieval options, including instantaneous value, mean value of multiple readings, and real-time chart display. Users can request the current sensor readings, calculate the average value over a specific period, or visualize the data in a dynamic chart, providing them with comprehensive insights into the sensor data.
